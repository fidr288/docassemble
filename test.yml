     The Doctor has requested that you have your ear/s syringed. As with any medical procedure there are risks associated with this. Even though we do everything possible to minimise these risks it is important that you read and understand the following information :  
     
     Potential problems can be:
     
     * Dizziness or Vertigo (head spinning)
     * Otitis externa (infection of ear canal)
     * Perforated tympanic membrane (ruptured ear drums) which can result in deafness.
     * Pain in the ear.
     
     To minimise the risk of perforation please inform the nurse if you have had any of the following problems :

     * Upper respiratory tract infection (head cold)
     * History of ear surgery or disease
     * Insertion of grommets
     * History of previous perforation (rupture) of the ear drums
