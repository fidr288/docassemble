  Cryotherapy is a treatment using liquid nitrogen to remove precancers, skin tags, warts, seborrheic keratosis, and skin growths by freezing them.  Sometimes it can take 2-3 treatments before it clears.
  [BR]冷冻治疗是透过液态氮的极低温度去除前期细胞癌, 皮肤息肉, 病毒疣, 脂漏性角化症 (俗称老人斑) 和皮肤增生. 大约需要2至3次或以上直到完全去除.
  
  **What to expect**[BR]冷冻疗法须知:
  
  Liquid nitrogen is extremely cold.  When sprayed on the skin the top skin layer rapidly freezes.  When you leave the clinic, the freezing site will probably be red and swollen, and it may sting and itch as it thaws.  Expect the site to feel like a bug bite.  It may look worse over the next few days before it gets better.  Swelling and/or blistering often develop within day after treatment.  2-3 days after treatment a scab will probably form which will then take 7-10 days to fall off, leaving a pink smooth area[BR]
  液态氮的温度非常低. 当接触皮肤时, 上层的皮肤会快速的冰冻. 当您离开诊所时, 治疗的部位在解冻后可能会红肿, 刺痛或者发痒. 可能会感觉像蚊虫叮咬. 在治疗部位改善前, 皮肤可能会呈现比原本的样子更糟的情况. 在治疗后的24小时内,治疗部位可能会肿胀及起水泡. 在治疗后的2-3天, 治疗部位可能会结痂并在7-10天后脱落, 呈现一个粉红色平滑的皮肤.
