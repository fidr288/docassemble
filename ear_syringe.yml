  Information and Consent for Ear Syringing[BR]
  外耳道冲洗法资料-知情同意
subquestion: |
  The Doctor has requested that you have your ear/s syringed. As with any medical procedure there are risks associated with this. Even though we do everything possible to minimise these risks it is important that you read and understand the following information:[BR]
  外耳道冲洗是一种很常用于清除在耳道的耳垢的方法. 温水透过压力控制注射器到受清洗的耳朵使耳垢脱落流出. 此方法很方便, 有效并安全. 此诊所的医生和护士都受过适当训练, 也进行过许多外耳道冲洗.然而任何医疗过程都潜在某种程度的风险, 我们需要您在进行程序前, 先阅读这份资料让您充分了解可能出现的问题和风险.
  
  Potential problems can be:[BR]
  潜在的并发症:
  
  * Dizziness or Vertigo (head spinning)[BR]
  恶心, 头晕或咳嗽.
  * Otitis externa (infection of ear canal)[BR]
  外耳炎
  * Perforated tympanic membrane (ruptured ear drums) which can result in deafness.[BR]
  在极少数的情况该治疗方法可能会导致更严重的伤害. 水的压力可能会把耳道鼓膜刺穿(也称为鼓膜穿孔). 这既不是一个预期或理想的结果, 但这是此治疗过程可能会出现的小风险. 尽管耳膜穿孔通常会自行痊愈, 疼痛和听力损失将需要进一步的治疗.
  * You may have to return for an additional consult if we cannot clear the wax in one session.[BR]
  该治疗方法不一定能一次清除所有耳垢. 我们可能需要您回诊再进行一次.

  除了外耳道冲洗法, 耳道抽吸法也可用来清除耳垢. 本诊所不能进行此项治疗方法, 但我们可以将你转诊至别的医疗诊所进行.
